# Python For AI&ML
Organized by UIU APP FORUM.

# Overview of Events
We are happy to announce that after the success of "Python for AI and ML: Seasons 1 to 3", we are back with "Python for AI and ML: Season 4". Python is the world’s fastest growing programming language. Its popularity is due to its simple yet powerful programming syntax, code readability and vast libraries. It provides great functionality to deal with mathematics, statistics and scientific function that make it very useful for data analysis. It also is used for machine learning and artificial intelligence. The workshop is designed to emphasize on giving learners the working knowledge needed to start programming, debugging and using Python in everyday tasks. At the same time, we will also demonstrate its uses in different fields in order to intrigue the learners’ interest in those fields.The workshop will be conducted by knowledgeable and hardworking instructors. It is open to all students of UIU however, please be noted that the prerequisite for this workshop is the Advanced Object Oriented Programming course so if you haven’t completed that course yet, please don’t register.
